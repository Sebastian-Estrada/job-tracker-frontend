# Job Tracker Frontend


## Problem Description

Job hunting can be a tedious and overwhelming process. Keeping track of job applications, follow-ups, and responses from potential employers can quickly become unmanageable. This project aims to simplify and streamline the job application process by providing a centralized platform to track and manage job applications.

## Project Description

The Job Tracker is a web application designed to help users manage their job applications efficiently. Users can add new job applications, update the status of their applications, and set reminders for follow-ups. The application provides a user-friendly interface to view and manage all job-related activities in one place.
